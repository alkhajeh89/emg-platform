# EMG™ Architecture Status

## Project Status

Architecture Phase: Frozen

Engineering Phase: Active

Current Branch: `feature/sprint-5-authorization-completion` (remains the
current branch until this sprint is merged)

Current Sprint: Sprint 5 (complete, pending merge)

---

## Approved Architecture

Architecture Baseline v1.0

Status: Frozen — changes require a new ADR.

---

## Modules — Architecture Approval Status

All ten modules are **architecture-approved** (design frozen in Architecture
Baseline v1.0, §Module Summary). Architecture approval means the module's
design has been reviewed and frozen by the Architecture Board — it does
**not** mean the module has been engineered yet. See "Modules — Engineering
Status" below for what actually exists in this repository.

| Module | Name | Architecture Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Module 1 | Repository Structure | Approved — Frozen |
| Module 2 | Development Environment | Approved — Frozen |
| Module 3 | Shared Libraries | Approved — Frozen |
| Module 4 | Identity & Authentication | Approved — Frozen |
| Module 5 | Enterprise Authorization & Policy Platform | Approved — Frozen |
| Module 6 | Enterprise Audit, Provenance & Digital Evidence Platform | Approved — Frozen |
| Module 7 | Enterprise Knowledge Graph Platform | Approved — Frozen |
| Module 8 | Enterprise Search, GraphRAG & Knowledge Retrieval Platform | Approved — Frozen |
| Module 9 | Enterprise AI Orchestration & Agent Platform | Approved — Frozen |
| Module 10 | Enterprise Decision Intelligence Platform | Approved — Frozen |

## Modules — Engineering Status

This table reflects what is actually implemented in this repository, verified
against `services/*/service.yaml` and the test suite — not aspirational
status.

| Module | Engineering Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Modules 1–3 (Foundation) | Complete | Sprint 1 — monorepo, shared library scaffolding, local dev environment, CI skeleton |
| Module 4 (Identity & Authentication) | Implemented through Sprint 3 | FEAT-02-1, FEAT-02-2 (Sprint 2); FEAT-02-3, FEAT-02-4 (Sprint 3) |
| Module 5 (Authorization & Policy) | Authorization baseline complete through FEAT-03-4 | FEAT-03-1, FEAT-03-2 (Sprint 4); FEAT-03-3 (RBAC Baseline Roles), FEAT-03-4 (Authorization Testing Harness) (Sprint 5). `services/authz` remains scaffolded (library-first approach; see Sprint 4 and Sprint 5 design docs). FEAT-04-1 (Audit Event Pipeline), grouped with FEAT-03-3/03-4 in the Backlog's Sprint 5 row, is rescheduled to the next Audit sprint (see Sprint 5 scope note below) |
| Module 6 (Audit) | Scaffolded | `services/audit/service.yaml`: `status: scaffolded`. No implementation yet. |
| Module 7 (Knowledge Graph) | Scaffolded | `services/knowledge-graph/service.yaml`: `status: scaffolded`. No implementation yet. |
| Module 8 (Search / GraphRAG / Retrieval) | Scaffolded | `services/retrieval/service.yaml`: `status: scaffolded`. No implementation yet. |
| Module 9 (AI Orchestration) | Scaffolded | `services/ai-orchestration/service.yaml`: `status: scaffolded`. No implementation yet. |
| Module 10 (Decision Intelligence) | Scaffolded | `services/decision-intelligence/service.yaml`: `status: scaffolded`. No implementation yet. |

A module's engineering status only advances when this repository proves it —
by committed, tested code — never by this document alone.

## ADRs

Only the following Architecture Decision Records are currently present in
`docs/architecture/`:

| ADR | Title | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ADR-014 | Enterprise Presentation Architecture | Approved — Frozen |
| ADR-015 | Unified Enterprise Observability | Approved — Frozen |
| ADR-016 | Enterprise Ownership Registry | Approved — Frozen |
| ADR-017 | Enterprise Capacity & Scalability Model | Approved — Frozen |

ADR-001 through ADR-013 are **not present in this repository** and must not
be described as approved, frozen, or existing until they are actually added
under `docs/architecture/`.

## Engineering Progress

| Sprint | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Sprint 1 | Complete |
| Sprint 2 | Complete |
| Sprint 3 | Complete |
| Sprint 4 | Complete |
| Sprint 5 | Complete |
| Sprint 6 | Planned |

Sprint scope for Sprint 4 onward follows the approved
`docs/architecture/EMG_Engineering_Backlog_v1.0.md` Sprint Planning table
(§6), not any simplified or alternate roadmap.

**Sprint 5 scope note — FEAT-04-1 rescheduling.** The Backlog's Sprint 5 row
(§6) groups three features: FEAT-03-3, FEAT-03-4, and FEAT-04-1 (Audit Event
Pipeline). Sprint 5 as executed implements only the two EPIC-03 authorization
features (FEAT-03-3, FEAT-03-4); FEAT-04-1 has been rescheduled to the next
Audit implementation sprint. This is an engineering sequencing decision only:
it does not modify the Architecture Baseline, does not redesign Module 6, and
does not create or require a new ADR. The Backlog's feature-to-epic
assignments are unchanged; only the sprint in which FEAT-04-1 is built has
moved.

## Branch Strategy

```
main       — Production
develop    — Integration
feature/*  — Current development
```

---

## Rules

Architecture is frozen.

Engineering implements the architecture.

No redesign without ADR.

---

## Last Updated

Sprint 4 merged successfully (PR #3, `feature/sprint-4-authorization-platform`
→ `develop` → `main`), delivering FEAT-03-1 (Policy Enforcement Point) and
FEAT-03-2 (ABAC Policy Engine Integration). Sprint 5
(`feature/sprint-5-authorization-completion`, EPIC-03 Authorization Platform
— FEAT-03-3 RBAC Baseline Roles, FEAT-03-4 Authorization Testing Harness) is
complete and pending merge; this completes the Module 5 authorization
baseline through FEAT-03-4. The branch remains
`feature/sprint-5-authorization-completion` until it is merged. FEAT-04-1
(Audit Event Pipeline), grouped with these two in the Backlog's Sprint 5
row, has been rescheduled to the next Audit sprint (see the Sprint 5 scope
note above).
